# [SUDOKU RULER](https://sudoku-ruler.netlify.app/)

This is NOT your average sudoku solver! 

Sudoku solvers are typically designed to leverage the high calculation speed of computers and the unique implementaion of data structures and algorithms which software affords to quickly find a solution to a given sudoku puzzle. 

If the goal of sudoku was simply to have a completed puzzle, these would be great...but it's the journey of solving a puzzle, not the mere destination of a solved puzzle that fuels the enjoyment of most human solvers.

This application aims not to simply output the solution to a sudoku, but instead to help you train to recognize patterns, strategies, and rules that people actually implement while solving sudoku puzzles and find enjoyment in doing so. It should do this by making it easy to visually scan the puzzle, fluidly and intuitively interact with it, and by giving you the freedom to test if particular strategies can help progress the state of the puzzle or even automatically solve certain rules which you might not care to manually solve at the moment. 

There are many more rules and features to be added in the future but the current state of the application now satisfactorily solves the minimum threshold of problems and lack of certain functionality I was having with all other solvers.
